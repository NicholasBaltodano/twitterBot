# Javascript
This will hold a number of projects that primarily use Javascript

<b>Practice Room </b>
</br>
This folder will hold a variety of files that I use to mess around and learn/try new things. This will not hold any specific project but rather many bits of different projects.

<b> Twitter Bot </b>
</br>
   This bot is programmed to search through its followers and tweet them a good morning message.
   It will also respond to any new followers with a greeting and notification of it's purpose. 
   Created on 5.29.17 by Nicholas Baltodano.
   
   The project uses Node.Js and the package Twit -> https://www.npmjs.com/package/twit
